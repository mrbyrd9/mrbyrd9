- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mrbyrd9.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software development, and am seeking to gain experience in most if not all fields pertaining to coding and computer science.
- ðŸŒ± I have used Java in multiple projects, and Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My next goals are Python, C++, and Ruby.
